# OmNomNom

This repository contains the OmNomNom retail website to demonstrate how a large system can be built using **service boundaries**.

## Presentations

The demo will be used in the presentation `Implementing the planet's largest e-commerce site using service boundaries`. At this moment there is not yet a recording available of the presentation.

The next presentation will be at:

- **[Techorama Belgium](https://techorama.be/speakers/session/implementing-the-planets-largest-ecommerce-site-using-service-boundaries/)** (May 8, 2024) 

## Service Boundaries

If you would like more information on implementing service boundaries in your system, contact me at dennis@compilesoftware.nl.

## Service Composition in the UI

The demo heavily relies on [ServiceComposer](https://github.com/ServiceComposer/ServiceComposer.AspNetCore/), a package built by [Mauro Servienti](https://github.com/mauroservienti). He discusses it deeply in many posts in the [ViewModel Composition](https://milestone.topics.it/categories/view-model-composition) category on his weblog.
